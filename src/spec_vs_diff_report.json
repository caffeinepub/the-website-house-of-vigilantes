  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements successfully. REQ-1 (landing page), REQ-2 (routing), REQ-3 (theme persistence), REQ-4 (logout redirect), REQ-5 (delete account redirect), and REQ-6 (modal overlay) are all implemented. REQ-7 (backend deleteAccount) is partially implemented but missing removal of editRequests. The required image is referenced but not confirmed to exist in the project.",

      "requirement": "Verify that the backend deleteAccount function in backend/main.mo properly removes all user data including profile, books, reviews/ratings, reading lists, and analytics when called",
      "reason": "The deleteAccount function removes profiles, books, bookSubmissions, readingProgressMap, ratingsMap, bookmarksMap, genrePreferencesMap, and lastAccessTime, but does not remove editRequests associated with the user. The AC specifies 'all user data' which should include edit requests.",
