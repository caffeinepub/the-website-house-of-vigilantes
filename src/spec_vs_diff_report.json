  "summary": "Comprehensive sidebar navigation with full UI pages implementation is substantially complete. All 10 requirements have been implemented with placeholder data and appropriate UI components. The diff shows evidence of sidebar navigation with all six items (Home, Books, Authors, Trending, Upload Book, Profile), Van Gogh-inspired styling, responsive design, and social feature UI elements. Minor gaps exist in mobile hamburger menu implementation and some advanced filtering UI details.",

      "reason": "Sidebar.tsx shows mobile overlay backdrop and slide-in behavior, but no explicit hamburger menu button/icon is visible in the diff. The toggle button uses ChevronLeft/ChevronRight icons, not a hamburger icon for mobile.",
