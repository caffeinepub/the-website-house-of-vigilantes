  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements but is missing the Van Gogh background image generation (REQ-1) and App.tsx routing updates (REQ-7). The diff shows CSS styling, Tailwind config, and HomePage component changes, but no actual image file or App.tsx modifications are present.",

      "requirement": "Generate a Van Gogh-inspired background image with vibrant, swirling colors and brushstroke textures suitable for a homepage hero section (dimensions: 1920x1080)",
      "reason": "No image file was generated or added. The HomePage.tsx references '/assets/generated/vangogh-hero.dim_1920x1080.png' but this file is not present in the added files list.",
