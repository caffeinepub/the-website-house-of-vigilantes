# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a unified Van Gogh-inspired homepage with expandable sections and clear navigation menus.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate a Van Gogh-inspired hero background image with vibrant swirling colors and brushstroke textures
- Create a new unified HomePage component with Van Gogh-inspired CSS effects overlaying the background
- Implement three prominent main menu options: "Browse Books" (navigates to /browse), "Mood-Based Recommendations" (expands on homepage), and "Trending & Popular" (expands on homepage)
- Add a secondary menu with links to Collection, Upload Book, My Books, and Favorites
- Style expanded sections to show mood-based book filters and trending books
- Ensure personalized content displays for logged-in users in expanded sections
- Apply clear typography with sufficient contrast against the artistic background
- Update App.tsx routing to use the new unified homepage as the default route

**User-visible outcome:** Users land on an artistic Van Gogh-inspired homepage with three main navigation options (Browse Books, Mood-Based Recommendations, Trending & Popular) and a secondary menu for platform features. Mood and trending sections expand directly on the homepage, providing a personalized dashboard experience for logged-in users.
