# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build comprehensive sidebar navigation with six navigation items (Home, Books, Authors, Trending, Upload Book, Profile) and create fully functional UI pages for each item with Van Gogh-inspired styling.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace existing sidebar with navigation items: Home, Books, Authors, Trending, Upload Book, and Profile
- Update sidebar styling to blue, gold, and white color scheme with Van Gogh-inspired textures and light/dark mode support
- Create Home page with hero section, personalized recommendations, and trending books
- Build Books browse page with search, filters, sorting, and mood-based carousels
- Create Authors list page with avatars, bios, and clickable profiles
- Build Trending page displaying popular books, moods, genres, and top-rated books
- Create Upload Book page/modal with form for book file upload, metadata entry, cover image, and series management
- Build Profile page with avatar, bio, reading lists, favorites, and Log Out/Delete Account buttons
- Add social feature UI elements including followers/following counters, review sections, and share buttons
- Ensure full responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile with hamburger menu on mobile

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate through a comprehensive sidebar to access Home, Books, Authors, Trending, Upload Book, and Profile pages, each with placeholder content and Van Gogh-inspired styling. The sidebar collapses smoothly and all pages resize dynamically. On mobile, the sidebar becomes a hamburger menu. Social features and account actions are visible but use placeholder data.
